This project implements Verlet integration to simulate particle physics in C, using GLFW for real-time visualization. You can directly run the `verlet_simulator` or other scripts (e.g., `simulate_impulse`, `simulate_potential`) inside `/bin`. The goal is to provide simple and visual simulations of particle physics. Currently implemented examples include gravity simulation, collision response, impulse dynamics, gas in a box, and particles in a potential field. Work on 3D simulations is in progress! ðŸ˜„

## Overview

Verlet integration is a numerical method used to simulate the motion of particles with great stability and minimal computational cost, even when forces become complex. This project leverages the Verlet algorithm to simulate realistic particle physics, including collision detection and response, in a 2D space. GLFW provides real-time rendering, enabling visual feedback and parameter adjustments like gravity, particle interaction, and potential fields.

## Features

- **Stable Verlet Integration**: Accurately simulates particle movement with position-based integration.
- **GLFW Visualization**: Real-time rendering of particles in a 2D environment.
- **Collision Handling**: Particle-to-particle and boundary collision detection with response.
- **Performance Efficient**: Handles a large number of particles smoothly.

## Requirements

To build and run the project, ensure the following are installed:

- **C compiler** (e.g., GCC or Clang) - add it to your system environment PATH
- **Make** for building the project

### Ubuntu Installation:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev libglfw3 xorg-dev build-essential make
```

### Windows Installation:
Install MSYS2 and use its package manager:
```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glfw mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
```


### How to use project

After installing necessary stuff, it is very straight forward to use my project.

1. Clone the repository recursively:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/davidomanovic/particle-simulator.git
```
2. Build the project with `make` simply by writing in terminal (inside the project repo):
```bash
make
```

3. Run the binaries from /bin (executable files) after building
```bash
./bin/gas_simulation
```
